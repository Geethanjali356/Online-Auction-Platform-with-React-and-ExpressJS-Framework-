# Online-Auction-Platform-with-React-and-ExpressJS-Framework-


                 The Online Auction Platform is a web-based application that enables users to create, manage, and participate in online auctions. It provides a secure and transparent bidding system where sellers can list items, set starting bids, and define auction closing times, while buyers can place competitive bids. The platform ensures user authentication and authorization, allowing only registered users to access auction functionalities.

                  To enhance security, password encryption is implemented to protect user credentials. Users are also given the ability to edit or delete their auctions, providing greater control over listings. The platform integrates real-time updates to ensure fair bidding and prevent fraudulent activities. Designed with an intuitive interface, the platform offers seamless navigation, making online auctions efficient, accessible, and user-friendly.
